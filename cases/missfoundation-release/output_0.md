For Immediate Release

[City], [State] - The Miss Foundation, a non-profit organization committed to advancing feminist policies and supporting women's bodily autonomy, strongly condemns the recent decision by the circuit court in Texas presided over by Matthew J. Kacsmaryk, to consider banning the use of the abortion medication mifepristone. The attempt to restrict access to this safe and effective medication is a direct attack on the fundamental rights of women across the country.

Mifepristone, also known as the abortion pill, is used by thousands of women across the United States to safely and effectively terminate early pregnancies. This medication has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for almost 20 years, and is used by millions of women worldwide. The decision to ban its use in any capacity is a blatant disregard for science and medical evidence.

At the Miss Foundation, we believe that every woman has the right to make their own medical decisions, and that includes the right to access safe and effective abortion services. Denying women the ability to access mifepristone is a direct attempt to undermine this right and keep women from being able to make decisions about their own bodies and their own futures.

Furthermore, the decision to ban mifepristone disproportionally affects women in low-income communities and areas that already have limited access to healthcare. This restriction could force women to resort to more dangerous methods of abortion, putting their lives and health at risk.

We urge lawmakers and judges not to restrict access to safe and legal abortion services. Women's bodily autonomy should not be up for debate, and their right to access medical care should not be restricted. The Miss Foundation stands with women across the country in the fight for their reproductive rights and will continue to fight for the right of every woman to make their own medical decisions.
